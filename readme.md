## Synopsis

Code to analyse the dust evolution in the NGTS flat fields

## Code Outline

Steps to quantify the rate of accumulation: <br/>
   1. Make master flats for each action
   1. Measure flux ratio of dusty/clean areas
   1. Repeat steps 1 & 2 using master-master flat from first ever flat action to correct all subsequent master flats. 
   1. Plot time series of flux ratio and master flats to look for changes caused by dust.

## Motivation

We've noticed lots of dust building up on the CCD window. We need to see exactly how much and then do something about it asap.
